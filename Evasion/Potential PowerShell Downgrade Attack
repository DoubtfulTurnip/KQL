Explanation

This query is designed to detect potential PowerShell downgrade attacks by analyzing command line inputs. Here's a simplified summary:

    Target Events: It looks at events related to processes (DeviceProcessEvents).
    Specific Programs: It focuses on processes where the file name is either powershell.exe or powershell_ise.exe.
    Command Line Indicators: It checks if the command line used to start these processes includes any of several variations indicating a request to use PowerShell version 2 (e.g., -v 2, -version 2.0, etc.).
    Exclusion: It excludes events where the initiating process is MonitoringHost.exe.

In essence, this query identifies instances where PowerShell is being run with commands that suggest a downgrade to version 2, which could be indicative of an attack, while ignoring legitimate monitoring processes.
