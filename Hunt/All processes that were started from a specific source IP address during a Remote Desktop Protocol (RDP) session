Explanation

This query retrieves information about all processes that were started from a specific source IP address during a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) session within the last day. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

    DeviceProcessEvents: This is the dataset being queried, which contains events related to processes on devices.
    Timestamp >= ago(1d): Filters the events to include only those that occurred in the last 24 hours.
    IsInitiatingProcessRemoteSession == "True": Ensures that only processes initiated during a remote session are considered.
    InitiatingProcessRemoteSessionIP == "X.X.X.X": Filters the events to include only those initiated from the specified IP address (you need to replace "X.X.X.X" with the actual IP address).
    project: Selects and displays specific columns from the filtered results:
        InitiatingProcessFileName: The name of the file that initiated the process.
        InitiatingProcessAccountSid: The security identifier (SID) of the account that initiated the process.
        InitiatingProcessCommandLine: The command line used to start the initiating process.
        FileName: The name of the file associated with the process.
        ProcessCommandLine: The command line used to start the process.

In summary, this query lists details about processes started from a specific IP during RDP sessions in the past day, including the file names and command lines involved.
