Explanation

This KQL (Kusto Query Language) query is designed to detect potential threat actors using CloudFlare tunnels to deliver Remote Access Trojans (RATs) via email. Here's a simple breakdown of what the query does:

    Source Table: It starts by looking at the UrlClickEvents table.
    Time Filter: It filters the events to only include those that occurred in the last 30 days (Timestamp > ago(30d)).
    Extract Domain: It extracts the domain part from the URL in each event (extend domain = tostring(parse_url(Url).Host)).
    Domain Filter: It further filters the events to only include those where the domain ends with ".trycloudflare.com".
    Join with Email Events: It joins these filtered URL click events with the EmailEvents table based on the NetworkMessageId field.
    Select Columns: Finally, it selects and displays specific columns: Timestamp, Url, RecipientEmailAddress, SenderMailFromAddress, SenderFromAddress, Subject, AttachmentCount, and UrlCount.

In summary, this query identifies and displays email events where recipients clicked on URLs that use CloudFlare tunnels, which could be a sign of malicious activity.
