Explanation

This query is designed to identify and highlight actions performed remotely by a compromised account on devices. Here's a simple breakdown of what it does:

    Data Source: It looks at DeviceProcessEvents, which contains information about processes on devices.
    Time Frame: It filters the data to include only events from the last 7 days.
    Compromised Account: It further filters the data to include only events initiated by a specific compromised account, identified by its Security Identifier (SID). You need to replace "SID" with the actual SID of the compromised account.
    Remote Sessions: It checks if the process was initiated from a remote session.
    Output: It selects and displays specific details about these processes, including:
        InitiatingProcessFileName: The name of the file that started the process.
        InitiatingProcessAccountSid: The SID of the account that started the process.
        InitiatingProcessCommandLine: The command line used to start the initiating process.
        FileName: The name of the file associated with the process.
        ProcessCommandLine: The command line used to start the process.

In summary, this query helps you find and review actions taken remotely by a compromised account within the last week.
